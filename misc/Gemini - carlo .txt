> I need help, I almost have my business site ready, its a IT support business oriented to assist small
  businesses or residences. The question is, how can I start? meaning, should I implement a ticketing
  system/remote access system from the get go? Be as detailed as possible

✦ Of course. This is an excellent question, and thinking about it now will save you major headaches later. The
  short answer is no, you likely don't need a full-blown, paid ticketing and remote access system from day one,
  but you need a plan to implement them very quickly.


  Let's break this down into a detailed "Crawl, Walk, Run" strategy. This approach lets you start lean, prove
  your business model, and then invest your revenue into tools that help you grow efficiently.

  Phase 1: The "Crawl" Stage (Your First 1-5 Clients)

  The goal here is to get started with minimal cost and complexity. Professionalism comes from your service and
   communication, not your tools at this point.


  1. Ticketing System -> Use a "Proto-Ticket" System:
   * What to use: A dedicated email address (e.g., support@yourbusiness.com) and a spreadsheet (Google Sheets
     or Excel).
   * How it works:
       1. A client emails your support address with a problem.
       2. You create a new row in your spreadsheet for the "ticket."
       3. Columns in your spreadsheet:
           * TicketID (Just number them sequentially: 1, 2, 3...)
           * ClientName
           * DateOpened
           * ReportedBy (e.g., John from Accounting)
           * Urgency (Low, Medium, High - your assessment)
           * ShortDescription
           * Status (New, In Progress, Awaiting Client, Resolved, Billed)
           * TimeSpent (Log every 15 minutes you work on it)
           * ResolutionNotes (CRITICAL: Write down how you fixed it!)
   * Why this works: It's free, fast to set up, and forces you to build the discipline of tracking work, which
     is the most important part of any ticketing system.


  2. Remote Access System -> Use Free & Ad-Hoc Tools:
   * What to use:
       * Google Remote Desktop: Free, secure, and tied to a Google account. Excellent for attended access (the
         user has to be there to give you the code).
       * AnyDesk (Free Tier): Very fast and reliable. Be aware of their terms; they monitor for commercial use
         and may prompt you to buy a license if usage is heavy.
       * Windows Quick Assist: Built into Windows 10/11. Simple and effective for attended access.
   * How it works: You direct the client on how to install or run the tool and provide you with the access
     code. You do not have unattended access at this stage, which is fine for residential or very small
     business clients initially.
   * Why this works: It's no-cost and gets the job done for initial, reactive support requests.

  ---

  Phase 2: The "Walk" Stage (You have steady work & 5-15 clients)


  You're now getting multiple requests a week, and the spreadsheet is starting to feel clumsy. You're wasting
  time looking for old notes. Now is the time to invest.


  1. Implement a True Ticketing System:
   * Why now?
       * Centralization: All communication (your replies, their replies) is in one place. No more digging
         through sent email folders.
       * Professionalism: Clients get a ticket number and can see a history of their requests.
       * Knowledge Base: You can turn your "Resolution Notes" from the spreadsheet into a searchable knowledge
         base for yourself, speeding up future fixes.
       * Metrics: You can track how long it takes to resolve issues, which clients require the most work, etc.
   * What to use:
       * Help Desk Software: Look at options like Freshdesk or Zoho Desk. They have free or very affordable
         entry-level plans that are perfect for a one-person operation.
       * Spiceworks Help Desk: A free, ad-supported option popular in the IT community.


  2. Implement a Professional Remote Access Solution:
   * Why now?
       * Unattended Access: This is a game-changer. You can schedule maintenance, run updates, or fix problems
         after-hours without the user being present. This is essential for business clients.
       * Branding: Many paid tools let you use a custom-branded client, which looks more professional.
       * Management & Security: You can manage a list of client computers, group them, and have more robust
         security and logging features.
   * What to use:
       * Splashtop: Very popular for this use case. It's affordable, reliable, and has different tiers
         depending on your needs (e.g., SOS for on-demand, Business Access for managed computers).
       * AnyDesk/TeamViewer (Paid): The paid versions unlock commercial use and management features.
       * RMM (Remote Monitoring & Management) Tools: This is the next level up.

  ---

  Phase 3: The "Run" Stage (Scaling your business)


  You're managing 20+ clients, and you want to shift from being reactive (fixing problems) to proactive
  (preventing them). This is where you become a true Managed Services Provider (MSP).


  1. Ticketing & Remote Access become one: The RMM
   * What is an RMM? A Remote Monitoring and Management platform. It combines ticketing, remote access, patch
     management, antivirus monitoring, scripting, and alerting into a single dashboard.
   * Why it's essential for scaling:
       * Efficiency: You can see the health of all your managed computers at a glance.
       * Automation: Automatically apply Windows updates, deploy software, and run maintenance scripts across
         all clients at once.
       * Proactive Alerts: Get an alert when a hard drive is failing or a server goes offline before the client
         even knows there's a problem.
   * What to use:
       * Atera or SyncroMSP: These are priced per technician, making them very affordable for a solo operator.
         They bundle everything you need to get started as an MSP.
       * NinjaOne or Datto RMM: More powerful (and more expensive) platforms that you can grow into.

  Summary & Direct Answer

  Don't pay for a ticketing/remote access system on Day 1.


   1. Start with a support@ email and a spreadsheet. Use free remote tools like Google Remote Desktop.
   2. Focus on getting clients and providing excellent, responsive service.
   3. When you feel the pain of your manual system (can't find info, emails are getting lost), use that as the
      trigger to invest your revenue into a proper help desk (like Freshdesk) and a paid remote access tool
      (like Splashtop).
   4. When you want to grow beyond break-fix and offer proactive managed services, move to an all-in-one RMM
      platform (like Atera).


  This phased approach ensures you're not spending money on tools you don't need yet, allowing you to build a
  sustainable and scalable business.

> Now, how technically ready do I have to be to start this venture and aim to become a MSP down the road?

✦ Excellent follow-up question. This is just as important as the business strategy. Your technical skill level
  directly impacts the quality of service you can offer, your efficiency, and the types of clients you can
  confidently take on.

  Think of your technical readiness as a pyramid. You must have a rock-solid foundation before you can build
  the higher, more complex layers required for a successful MSP.

  Level 1: The Foundation (Break-Fix & Small Business Support)


  This is the minimum viable skill set you need to start your business and handle the most common requests from
   residences and small businesses (<10 employees). You must be proficient and confident in these areas before
  your first client call.


  1. Hardware Proficiency:
   * PC/Laptop Internals: You need to be able to diagnose and replace any component without hesitation: RAM,
     SSD/HDD, Power Supply (PSU), motherboard, CPU, fans.
   * Peripherals: Master troubleshooting printers, scanners, webcams, and monitors. Printer issues will be a
     surprisingly large part of your early work.


  2. Operating System Mastery (Windows & macOS):
   * Installation & Repair: Confidently perform clean installs, in-place upgrades, and use recovery/repair
     tools to fix boot issues.
   * Core Troubleshooting: Diagnose and resolve performance issues (slowness, freezing), driver conflicts, and
     system errors using tools like Event Viewer, Task Manager, and Resource Monitor.
   * User & File Management: Understand user profiles, file permissions (NTFS), and data migration from an old
     PC to a new one.
   * Malware Removal: You must have a reliable, multi-step process for identifying and removing viruses,
     spyware, and adware. This goes beyond just running a single scan.


  3. Fundamental Networking:
   * SOHO Networks: Be an expert in small office/home office setups. This means routers, modems, Wi-Fi, and
     switches.
   * Core Concepts (The "Alphabet Soup"): You must have a practical, working knowledge of DHCP (what gives out
     IPs), DNS (what translates names to IPs), and the difference between a public and private IP address. You
     will be troubleshooting "I can't get on the internet" daily.
   * Wi-Fi Troubleshooting: Diagnose and solve issues with weak signals, dropped connections, and channel
     interference.


  4. Common Application Support:
   * Email Clients: Be prepared to troubleshoot Outlook and other mail clients (e.g., connection issues,
     corrupt data files like .PST/.OST, profile problems).
   * Web Browsers: Fix issues with extensions, hijacked settings, and performance.
   * Microsoft Office Suite: Handle installation, activation, and common problems within Word, Excel, etc.

  Level 2: The Bridge to MSP (Proactive & Value-Add Services)

  Once you've mastered the foundation, you can start learning the skills to transition from reactive break-fix
  to proactive managed services. You can learn these as you grow, but you should be actively studying them from
   day one.


  1. Automation & Scripting:
   * Why it's critical: This is the core of being an MSP. You cannot scale if you have to manually touch every
     machine for every task.
   * What to learn: Start with PowerShell for Windows. Learn to write simple scripts to automate tasks like
     clearing temp files, installing software silently, or changing a registry key. This is non-negotiable for
     long-term success.


  2. Centralized Management & Business-Grade Services:
   * Cloud Identity: Learn to set up and manage a Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace tenant. This includes
     creating users, managing email, and setting up basic security policies. This is one of the first major
     value-adds you can offer a small business.
   * Directory Services: Understand the basics of Active Directory (for on-premise servers) and its cloud
     equivalent, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). Know how to join a computer to a domain.
   * Backup & Disaster Recovery (BDR): Go beyond simple file backups. Learn about imaging, bare-metal recovery,
     and the difference between a backup and a true BDR solution. Research and test BDR software.


  3. Intermediate Networking & Security:
   * Business-Grade Firewalls: Learn the basics of configuring a proper firewall (e.g., a Ubiquiti, Fortinet,
     or SonicWall device), including setting up port forwarding, firewall rules, and VPN access.
   * Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Move beyond basic antivirus. You need to understand and be able to implement
     Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), configure email filtering, and educate clients on phishing.

  ---

  Level 3: The MSP Capstone (Strategic & Scalable Management)

  These are the skills that define a mature, efficient, and profitable MSP.


   * RMM Platform Mastery: Deeply learn your chosen Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tool (like Atera,
     Syncro, NinjaOne). This becomes your command center. Master its scripting engine, monitoring and alerting,
     and patch management capabilities.
   * Advanced Security: Understand security frameworks and how to implement layered security (endpoint
     protection, DNS filtering, security awareness training, etc.).
   * Virtualization: Have a working knowledge of Hyper-V or VMware for managing servers.
   * Cloud Infrastructure: Learn the basics of cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure or AWS for hosting servers
     and applications.

  Your Action Plan:


   1. Be Honest About Level 1: Can you confidently handle every single item in the "Foundation" list right now?
       If not, that's your starting point. Use online courses (Udemy, Coursera), YouTube (Professor Messer is a
       legend), and build a home lab to practice until it's second nature.
   2. Get Certified: Certifications provide structured learning and prove your knowledge.
       * Start with CompTIA A+: This is the absolute baseline for hardware and OS support.
       * Move to CompTIA Network+: This will solidify your networking fundamentals.
       * Then CompTIA Security+: This gives you the language and concepts for modern cybersecurity.
   3. Build a Home Lab: This is the most important step. Get a couple of old PCs. Install Windows Server. Set
      up Active Directory. Create a virtual network. Break things and then force yourself to fix them. Try to
      deploy software with a PowerShell script. This hands-on experience is more valuable than any book.


  Bottom Line: You don't need to be a Level 3 expert on day one. But you must be a master of Level 1. Your
  first clients are your reputation. Start with a solid foundation of break-fix skills and an insatiable desire
   to learn and climb the pyramid toward becoming a full-fledged MSP.

> Do you think this could turn out to be a lucrative career if located in Gdl, Mexico? I dont want to become
  rich, just live comfortably (affor my hobbies, be able to build my own house eventually, vacations to other
  countries, nothing too extravagant)

✦ Yes, absolutely. Moving into IT support with the goal of becoming an MSP in Guadalajara is not just a viable
  career path; it has the potential to be an incredibly lucrative and fulfilling one that can comfortably meet
  the lifestyle goals you've described.

  Guadalajara is arguably the best city in Mexico for this specific venture. Here’s a detailed breakdown of
  why, and how it maps to your goals.

  The Guadalajara Advantage: A Perfect Storm of Opportunity


  You're not just in any city; you're in "Mexico's Silicon Valley." This isn't just a marketing slogan; it's a
  reality that creates a massive opportunity for you.


   1. The Booming Tech & Business Ecosystem:
       * Major Hub: GDL is a hub for international tech giants (Intel, HP, Oracle, etc.) and advanced
         manufacturing. This creates a "halo effect": thousands of smaller companies spring up to support them,
         from logistics and catering to marketing and specialized parts suppliers.
       * Nearshoring: Companies are actively moving their operations from Asia and other parts of the world to
         Mexico to be closer to the US market. GDL is a prime destination. These new and expanding businesses
         need IT support immediately, and they are used to paying for professional, reliable service.
       * The SMB Backbone: The vast majority of businesses in Jalisco are small to medium-sized businesses
         (SMBs or PyMEs). Many are family-owned, have been around for years, and are just now realizing that
         their nephew who is "good with computers" is not a sufficient IT strategy. This is your primary
         market.


   2. The Growing Pains of Digitization:
       * Cybersecurity is a Real Fear: High-profile ransomware attacks in Mexico have made even small business
         owners nervous. They are now more willing to pay for things they didn't care about five years ago:
         professional backups, firewalls, and security policies.
       * Digital Transformation is Mandatory: The Mexican government's requirements (like CFDI 4.0 for
         invoicing) force businesses to rely on technology. When their systems are down, they can't bill
         customers. This makes reliable IT a critical business function, not a luxury.


   3. The "Comfortable Life" Financial Reality:
       * Your Goal: Afford hobbies, build a house, travel internationally. This is a very achievable
         upper-middle-class lifestyle in Guadalajara.
       * The Math of an MSP: Let's run some conservative, illustrative numbers.
           * Phase 1: Break-Fix: You might start by charging, for example, $600 - $900 MXN per hour for
             reactive support. This pays the bills.
           * Phase 2: The MSP Transition: You start signing clients to monthly contracts. Your goal is to get
             to a Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) model.
           * Pricing Model: You'll charge per user or per device. A very competitive starting rate might be
             $800 - $1,500 MXN per user per month. This fee includes your support, monitoring, antivirus, and
             backup management.


       * Illustrative Income Scenario:
          Imagine you work hard for 2-3 years and build a solid reputation. You land 10 small business clients,
   with an average of 10 employees each.
           * 10 clients * 10 users/client = 100 users
           * 100 users  $1,000 MXN/user/month = $100,000 MXN per month in revenue.*


          Even after accounting for your software costs (RMM, antivirus, backups), you are left with a very
  healthy income that places you squarely in the comfortable lifestyle you desire. Building your own house and
  taking vacations are very realistic goals with this level of income in GDL.

  Your Strategic Path to That Comfortable Life in GDL


   1. The Bilingual Superpower: If you are fluent in both English and Spanish, you have a massive, almost
      unfair advantage. You can perfectly serve Mexican companies, but you can also be the go-to provider for
      US/Canadian companies setting up shop in GDL who need a local expert that understands their business
      culture and standards. You can market yourself as the bridge between the two.


   2. Find Your Niche: Don't try to be everything to everyone. Focus on a vertical that is strong in the
      region.
       * Manufacturing: The industrial parks are full of small manufacturers who need their machines to stay
         online.
       * Logistics & Transportation: A massive industry in GDL.
       * Professional Services: Law firms, accounting firms, and marketing agencies whose entire business
         depends on their computers working.
       * Expat & Remote Workers: Support the high-paid remote workers for international companies who live in
         areas like Chapalita, Providencia, etc.


   3. Out-Professional the Competition: Your main competition won't be other polished MSPs at first. It will be
       the informal, unreliable "IT guys." You win by being the opposite:
       * Be incredibly responsive.
       * Communicate clearly and professionally (in Spanish and/or English).
       * Provide simple, clear invoices.
       * Talk about business outcomes, not just technical specs. Instead of "You need a new server," say "To
         prevent your team from losing access to their files and stop work, we need to upgrade the system that
         stores your data."

  Conclusion:


  Yes, this is a very good career choice in Guadalajara. The city's economic trajectory is perfectly aligned
  with the services you want to offer. There is a clear and present demand from a massive market of underserved
   small and medium-sized businesses.


  By starting with a solid technical foundation, focusing on professionalism, and leveraging the unique
  advantages of the GDL market, you can absolutely build a business that not only survives but thrives,
  allowing you to achieve the comfortable and fulfilling life you've described. The question isn't if the
  opportunity exists; it's how effectively you can execute the plan to capture it.

> Do you think "Termina Tech Solutions" is a fitting name I could build this whole idea upon?

✦ That's a great question. A name is the foundation of your brand, and "Termina Tech Solutions" is a very
  interesting choice. Let's break it down from a branding and marketing perspective, especially for the
  Guadalajara market.


  Short Answer: It's a clever, memorable name with a strong "double meaning," but it comes with a slight
  risk you need to manage.

  ---

  The Analysis: A Double-Edged Sword

  The name works on two levels, one in Spanish and one in English, which is its greatest strength and its
  main weakness.

  1. The Spanish Meaning (The Big Pro):


   * "Termina" = "It Ends" / "It Finishes"
   * The Marketing Hook: This is brilliant. You can build your entire brand message around this idea: "Termina
      Tech Solutions: Donde los problemas de tecnología terminan." (Where technology problems end).
   * The Value Proposition: It immediately communicates the core benefit you offer: resolution. You are the
     one who brings an end to the client's frustration. It's a powerful, confident statement. For a local
     Spanish-speaking business owner, this is a fantastic and memorable message.


  2. The English/Tech Meaning (The Pro & Con):


   * "Terminal": The name evokes the word "terminal," as in a computer terminal (like a command line) or a
     network endpoint. For tech-savvy clients, this gives you instant credibility. It sounds professional and
     suggests you have deep technical knowledge.
   * "Terminate": This is the risky part. In English, "terminate" is a very harsh word. It means to kill, to
     end forcefully. Think of "The Terminator." It can imply ending contracts, firing employees, or something
     being destroyed.

  ---


  The Verdict: It's a Good Name, IF...

  "Termina Tech Solutions" is a strong, high-potential name, if you actively shape its meaning. You cannot
  just put the name out there and hope people interpret it positively.

  You should use it if:


   * You are prepared to lean into the Spanish marketing hook. Your slogan, your website's headline, and your
     elevator pitch should all reinforce the "we end your problems" message.
   * You are confident that your professionalism and communication style can overcome any initial negative
     flicker from the word "terminate" for your English-speaking clients.
   * You want a name that is bold and memorable rather than safe and generic.

  You might reconsider if:

   * You want a name that is 100% safe and requires zero explanation.
   * You are primarily targeting large, conservative corporate clients who might be put off by a name with any
      potential ambiguity.

  ---


  Actionable Next Steps (Crucial!)

  Before you commit, do this immediately:


   1. Check Domain Availability: This is the most important step. Go to a domain registrar (like GoDaddy,
      Namecheap, or Akky.mx for .com.mx domains) and see if terminatech.com and terminatech.com.mx are
      available. If they are taken, the name is likely a no-go.
   2. Check Social Media Handles: See if "TerminaTech" or "TerminaTechSolutions" is available as a username on
      Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter/X. Consistent branding is key.
   3. Do a Google Search: Search for "Termina Tech" in Mexico. Is there another tech company with a similar
      name? You don't want to be confused with a competitor or, worse, a company with a bad reputation.
   4. Say It Out Loud: Call a friend and say, "I'm starting a business called Termina Tech Solutions." Does it
      roll off the tongue? Is it easy to understand over the phone?
   5. Test It: Ask a few people (ideally a mix of Spanish and English speakers who could be your potential
      clients) what they think of the name without explaining it to them. Their first impression is priceless
      data.

  Conclusion:


  I personally like the name. It's clever, it's strong, and it's perfect for a bilingual market like
  Guadalajara. The positive marketing angle of "ending problems" is far more powerful than the slight risk
  of the English meaning.


  Go for it, but do so with a clear branding strategy. Own the narrative. Make "Termina" mean "The End of
  Your IT Headaches."

> Lastly, you mentioned phase 1 as a stage where the tool selection is a bit less strict, I can use free tools
   such as Google Sheets to keep track of tickets, etc. Is it good practice to start this few jobs for clients
   as remote interactions? Like for instance, a business contacts me to check why their printer is not
  working, would it be professional to first try to resolve the issue remotely? I know there are issues that
  have to be faced in person, like internet/WiFi issues, configuring network appliances, etc.

✦ That is a fantastic and critical question. The answer is an emphatic YES.


  Starting with a "remote-first" approach is not just good practice; it is the hallmark of a modern,
  efficient, and profitable IT support business. It is arguably more professional than immediately driving
  to the client's site.

  Here’s the detailed breakdown of why and how to implement this strategy perfectly.

  Why Remote-First is the Professional Standard


   1. Demonstrates Efficiency and Respect for the Client's Time (and Money):
       * Your Pitch: "Mr./Ms. Client, my goal is to solve your problem as quickly and cost-effectively as
         possible. Many issues, even with hardware like printers, are actually software-related. If I can fix
         this for you remotely in the next 15 minutes, it will save you the cost and delay of an onsite
         service call."
       * The Result: You position yourself as a smart, efficient partner, not just a pair of hands. You are
         saving them money from the very first interaction. This builds immense trust.


   2. It's a Powerful Triage Tool:
       * You can't be in two places at once. If you are driving to fix a simple printer queue issue for Client
          A, you can't be helping Client B, who just had their server go down.
       * Remote support lets you quickly diagnose the severity of a problem. You can assess the situation, and
          if it does require an onsite visit, you arrive prepared with the right tools and parts because
         you've already done the initial investigation.


   3. It Makes Your Business Scalable:
       * Your most limited resource is your time, specifically your travel time. A remote-first model allows
         you to serve more clients in a day. You can build a business that serves clients across Guadalajara,
         not just in your immediate neighborhood. This is fundamental to your goal of becoming an MSP.


   4. It Filters Your Clientele:
       * Clients who understand and appreciate this efficient model are the exact kind of modern businesses
         you want to build long-term relationships with. Clients who insist on an in-person visit for every
         minor issue are often less profitable and more difficult to manage.

  Let's use your excellent example: A client calls because their printer isn't working.

  Step 1: The Initial Contact & Setting the Frame


   * Client: "Hi, my printer isn't working. Can you come take a look?"
   * You (The Professional): "Absolutely, I can help with that. My process is to start with a quick remote
     session, as I can often resolve these kinds_of issues in just a few minutes without needing to charge you
      for an onsite visit. Do you have 5-10 minutes to try that now?"_

  Step 2: The Remote Triage & Attempted Fix

  You guide them to run your remote access tool of choice (AnyDesk, Google Remote Desktop, etc.). Once
  connected, you perform the classic printer troubleshooting steps:


   * Check the Print Queue: Is it stuck? Clear it. (Solves 50% of cases).
   * Check the Printer Status: Is it showing as "Offline" in Windows?
   * Check Connectivity: Can you ping the printer's IP address from the computer? If not, you know it's a
     network issue.
   * Check the Spooler Service: Is the Print Spooler service running on the PC? Restart it.
   * Check Drivers: Are the correct drivers installed? Reinstall them.

  Step 3: The Decision Point


  You will quickly fall into one of two camps:


   * Success! You fixed it remotely. You are a hero. You just solved their problem in 20 minutes. You send a
     small, reasonable invoice for your time, and they are thrilled with the value.
   * Escalation to Onsite: You determine the issue is physical or network-related.
       * Example Diagnosis: "Okay, I've confirmed the software and drivers on your computer are perfect, but
         the computer isn't getting any response from the printer itself. This suggests the printer has lost
         its connection to your network. I will need to come onsite to resolve this. I can be there this
         afternoon."

  Step 4: The Onsite Visit (Now with Purpose)

  When you arrive onsite, you are not starting from zero. You walk in with confidence:


   * "As we saw in the remote session, the PC is fine. I'm going to start by checking the network cable on the
      printer and confirming its network settings directly on the device's little screen."

  You look incredibly competent because you've already ruled out all the software issues.

  Handling Specific Scenarios


   * Printers: Perfect for remote-first. Most printer problems are not broken hardware; they are driver
     issues, network conflicts, or stuck print queues.
   * Internet/WiFi Issues: Even here, remote triage is key. You can't connect to their computer, but you can
     be on the phone with them: "What lights are on your modem? Are they blinking? What color are they?" This
     tells you if the problem is with their ISP or their internal network before you even start your car.
   * Configuring Network Appliances: This will almost always require an onsite visit. But you'll schedule this
      visit after a remote consultation call where you define the project scope and give them a quote.

  Conclusion:


  Starting with a remote-first support model is not just "good enough" for Phase 1; it is the best practice.
   It establishes you as a modern, efficient, and value-oriented professional from your very first client
  interaction. It builds trust, saves everyone time and money, and creates the scalable foundation you need
  to grow into a successful MSP.
